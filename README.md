# LeetCode
Code snippets for interviews practice from Leet code and misc. sources
## 1. Greedy Algorithms 
Algorithms that solve problem by dividing the problem into small sub-problem, where solution to each sub-problem has the consistent solution devised by the policy called safe step. [practice problems](https://github.com/shahrukhx01/LeetCode/tree/master/week3_greedy_algorithms)

## 2. Divide and Conquer (Linear Search O(n), Binary Search(logn), Selection O(n^2), Quick O(nlogn),Worst: O(n^2) and Merge Sort O(nlogn))
Algorithms that solve problem by dividing the problem into small non overlapping sub-problems and solve each sub-problem separately. [practice problems](https://github.com/shahrukhx01/LeetCode/tree/master/week4_divide_and_conquer)
